        <h1>Crocodiles</h1>
        <p>Crocodiles are among the most dangerous and powerful predators on Earth. Here are some fascinating facts about them:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Crocodiles have been around for over 200 million years, dating back to the time of the dinosaurs.</li>
            <li>The largest crocodile species is the saltwater crocodile, which can grow up to 7 meters (23 feet) in length and weigh over 1,000 kilograms (2,200 pounds).</li>
            <li>They are ambush predators, waiting silently for prey to approach the water's edge before striking with incredible speed and force.</li>
            <li>Crocodiles have the most powerful bite force of any animal on Earth, with some species biting down at over 3,700 psi (pounds per square inch).</li>
            <li>Despite their immense power, crocodiles can go months without eating, surviving on the energy from a single large meal.</li>
            <li>They use a technique called the "death roll," where they spin rapidly in the water to tear apart prey or drown it.</li>
            <li>Crocodiles can stay underwater for up to an hour, using special muscles to slow their heart rate and conserve oxygen.</li>
            <li>They have excellent night vision, which makes them highly effective nocturnal hunters.</li>
            <li>While they spend much of their time in the water, crocodiles are surprisingly fast on land and can run up to 17 kilometers per hour (11 mph) for short distances.</li>
            <li>Crocodile mothers are protective of their young, carrying their hatchlings in their mouths to the water and staying close for several months after birth.</li>
        </ul>
